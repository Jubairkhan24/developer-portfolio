        <p>I am a student of class 10. Basically my goal was something else. But the corona situation changed my life. I
            started
            to learn C programming then I finally met with Javascript and web development. That'why I am learning and
            mastering
            web development. I will not stop until I become the Web Development Hero.</p>
